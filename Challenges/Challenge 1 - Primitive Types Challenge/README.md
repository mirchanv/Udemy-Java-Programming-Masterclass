# Challenge 1 : Primitive Types Challenge

Problem Statement: 
Your challenge is to create four new variables:
-   A **byte** variable, set it to any valid **byte** number, it doesn't matter.
-   A **short** variable, set it to any valid **short** number.
-   An **int** variable,  set it to any valid **integer** number.
-   Lastly, create a variable of type **long**. Make it equal to 50,000 plus 10 times the sum of the **values of the first 3 variables (your byte, your short and your int values).  In other words, use the variable names in your expression to calculate the sum**.
